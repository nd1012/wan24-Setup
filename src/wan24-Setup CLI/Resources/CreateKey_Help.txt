The private key suite will contain an asymmetric primary and a counter 
signature key, using these algorithms:

    - Primary: ECDSA
    - Counter: CRYSTALS-Dilithium

The private key suite will be encrypted with your given password using 
Serpent-256-CBC (HMAC-SHA3-512 authenticated).

Your given password will be stretched two times using

    1. PBKDF#2 with 250.000 iterations and SHA3-384 hash
    2. Argon2id with a memory limit of 46M

Optional the final password will be a HMAC, which will be created using the 
highest available TPM 2.0 HMAC algorithm.

Your private key suite file will be written to the given filename. An 
additional "[FILENAME].ksr" file contains a signature request for your 
signature keys. Please send this KSR-file with email to 
[link=mailto:nd@wan24-office.de]nd@wan24-office.de[/]. After your public 
signature key was approved and signed, you'll get a signed public key back 
with email, which you can then merge to your private key suite using the 
"finalizeKey" CLI API method.
