wan24-Setup CLI (c) 2024 Andreas Zimmermann, wan24.de
=====================================================

Replace "installerPackage" with "dotnet tool run wan24setup", if you want to 
use this CLI as .NET tool.

Create a signature key and a signing request:

	installerPackage -createKey --path [FOLDERNAME] --pwd [VARIABLE] (-tpm) --email [EMAIL]

The given email address will be embedded into your signed key. Send the 
created "public.ksr"" file with email to nd@wan24-office.de. The "private.key" 
file is your secret signature key. You'll need the given password (and the 
used TPM), if you want to use it.

Create an installer package:

	installerPackage --create [FILENAME] --path [FOLDERNAME] (--sign [KEYFILENAME] --signed [SIGNEDKEYFILENAME] --pwd [VARIABLE] (-tpm))

The last line of the output to STDOUT is the uncompressed length in bytes.

Extract an installer package:

	installerPackage --extract [FILENAME] --path [FOLDERNAME]

Install a package:

	installerPackage --install [FILENAME] --path [FOLDERNAME] (-allowUnsigned)

NOTE: [FILENAME] may also be a http(s) URI.

Optional arguments:

-v, -version
	Display the version number and exit.

-h, -help
	Display this help and exit.

--sign [KEYFILENAME]
	Sign the package using a private signature key.

--signed [SIGNEDKEYFILENAME]
	Filename of your signed public signature key.

--pwd [VARIABLE]
	Specify the environment variable which contains the key for decrypting the 
	private signature key.

-tpm
	Use the TPM to protect the encryption key.

-allowUnsigned
	Allowing running an unsigned setup.
